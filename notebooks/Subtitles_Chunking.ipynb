after training The eel is really good at that one place Shiho Yes Heres a gift Ive sent you footage from the Moscow competition Take a close look at that Itll help you prepare for the competition Do well Thank you Can you believe the coach Just because Shiho won a competition shes showing her favoritism now She loves her again now I thought it was our Soobin that she liked It wont last very long You cant put a broken plate back together Why wont Mom pick up her phone Shiyeon Shiho Whats up Why didnt you call beforehand Shiho Whats wrong Is something wrong I think Mom and Dad are getting a divorce What Theyve been fighting a lot lately Dad isnt coming home anymore I think theyre really getting a divorce this time Its okay Shiyeon Its okay Dont cry its okay Ill take care of this Its okay so dont cry I told Shiyeon not to tell you You were going to keep it from me When were you going to tell me After you sign the divorce papers Or when both of you find other people and get remarried Or were you trying to keep it from me forever Why are you raising your voice People know who you are Why is that important right now Weve lost the house too didnt we And Dads credit has been ruined for some time now Its okay dont worry about it Dont worry about our divorce and just focus on your own work How could I not care about you and Dad Shiho I dont want to do gymnastics anymore I want to make money You cant decide to quit by yourself Do you think your life only belongs to yourself No your life is my life too People pointed fingers at me for putting you on a pedestal Ive fought with your father day after day and Ive had to deal with Shiyeons criticism too What about my life Thats what was the hardest for me The fact that my life is yours Why are you being greedy with my life Why didnt you live your own life properly Why did you give birth to me and put me through all this Shiho Why are you craving curry in the middle of the night I suddenly wanted to eat your curry Mom Because of this curry I dont think I can marry anyone else Thats your mothers ploy Im a victim of that ploy Why didnt you marry the restaurant lady instead of the pharmacist Hey did I say something wrong Yes I

With my age and all Youre right You should be climbing the ranks right now Dont worry be happy But about your Mom Not your adoptive parents but your real mother Did you ever consider looking for your mother No I havent Im sure you were always curious My mom probably had her reasons for cutting contact And I think I felt bad for my uncle and my aunt Because it feels like betrayal They raised me with a lot of love Yes I think I understand But I still think you should face it headon The betrayal you feel from your birth mother the complicated feelings of thankfulness and remorse toward your aunt and uncle and the difficulty of pretending not to know about the postcards You need to face those emotions if youre ever going to overcome your trauma Thats just my opinion I should give the doctor a call Lee Sunok can you accept my apology and take this Forget it I dont want it Can you get out of my way I may be invisible to you but this is my bed after all Yeah But Sunok Can you give it a rest now I understand that you were hurt but I wasnt trying to keep it from you Of course not You threw a rock without meaning to hit me and Im just being selfish now Thats not what I meant No its my fault for not being understanding And its my fault that you couldnt trust me Hey are you really going to keep this up Why are you raising your voices I dont want you two to fight That girl is being unreasonable Hey if you put it that way Im disappointed in you too Hey Kim Bokjoo Are you getting angry with me Im going through enough already Why do I have to deal with you too I cant believe youre turning this on me Do you think Im having fun right now So stop it already girl But I cant just forget about this You guys shut up If youre going to fight fight outside Do you guys want to get kicked out Have you guys even considered me lately Im new to Seoul and I considered you two my only family here But I was fooling myself Dont take it the wrong way We feel the same about you Bokjoo had to tell me because I read her text messages Then you shouldve told me when she was caught by the coach Nanhee you kept it from me and what did you say to me You told me to give Bokjoo some space and made me an inconsiderate friend That wasnt Nanhees fault I asked her to keep my secret So why are you keeping secrets I didnt want to do it It was hard keeping secrets I wanted to tell you several times each day But how do you expect me to talk about this I knew how ridiculous I was acting And even if youre my friend it was obvious youd be disappointed I couldnt tell you because it was humiliating Why is that humiliating between us Friends tell each other things and they work it out together Dont I mean anything to you guys Sunok is right on that one Im sorry I thought you guys would be disappointed and think I was pathetic No Im sorry Why are you crying Hey I know it was hard for you You poor thing Guys I promise never to keep secrets from you again Why are you crying Hey I told you

Mary before God got His mitts on her and she was pretty wild Dont have to tell me I was the person she was wild with Oh she was wild long before she ever met you What do you mean Did you think that you were the first person she was wild with Well yeah And just when the Enterprise is about to be assimilated by the Borg another ship appears piloted by Wesley Crusher Uhhuh Its surprising because

Okay So this is unexpected Well I know you like margaritas so my first thought was a Mexican restaurant Good thought But I assumed other men had come to that same conclusion They have Which led me to Polynesian fare I like to think of the Mai Tai as the margarita of the South Pacific You dont do anything on a whim do you Did once didnt like it I have an idea for a Star Trek episode Id like to present to you Why me Because Im hoping to sell it and since its going to be broadcast television I want to make sure the common man can understand it Well I understand I was just insulted Excellent I came to the right common man We start on a gas giant in the vicinity of Rigel IV then see a shuttle craft a dot of silver against the inky blackness of space Inside the shuttle craft we see Lieutenant Worf struggling to breathe Hes been infected by a vicious intelligent fungus Where are you going Im listening Cough cough Worf is choking on spores but not just your everyday spores these are spores with their own evil agenda Uhhuh And as he sinks into a coma a mysterious figure in a spacesuit approaches He lowers the visor of his helmet revealing Future Worf Are you hooked Oh yeah Main titles Cue theme song and the soothing voice of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard says Space the final frontier Whos Patrick Stewart Feeling better Im fine just having a little moment earlier Oh yeah All right Mm Mmm Seems like running into Pastor Rob kind of kind of rattled you a little bit Oh well I was asked to leave the church and hes still there so its still a little fresh Mm Yeah I get that Seems like a nice guy though Oh yeah hes great Cute as a button I guess I prefer a bigger man Like George Oh yeah Bigger the better Deep within the Enterprises control room Future Worf says I willingly sacrifice myself for the good of this mission then throws himself into the warp core Theres an explosion of tachyons The Enterprise blasts free of the gigantic field of fungus Fade out Written by Sheldon Lee Cooper What do you think If this Worf fella was infected on the shuttles why would he come back to the Enterprise and put everyone else in danger Well My father found a flaw in my story my sister had a job I envied It was a big day for the common man But then I had an idea that like Future Worf was ahead of its time Missy What Why is a dollar worth a dollar Sheldon Im busy Me too Ive solved all of our money problems Im going to invent my own digital currency Like printing your own No First we assign value to difficulttofind numbers and store them in a computer database

assassin Yeah that Weve been on the run for three days and somehow he keeps finding us Its not looking good Well he hasnt gotten us yet has he Yeah Because he jumped through a stainedglass window and landed like a cat Mmhm I can do that too He has superhuman strength Well I have superbeast strength Bullets cant even stop him Hes got me there This isnt a joke Vincent Were not moving forward Were moving backward Were living in the shadows just like you used to Yes until you rescued me right Yeah but now we have to rescue each other Whoever is behind these experiments knows who we are now That doesnt just put us in danger it puts everyone we care about in danger too Which means hes not gonna stop coming after us until he succeeds Which is why we gotta put our focus back on whoever sent the guy okay Cut the head off the snake stop them before they stop us so we can finally get married Thats if you still want to get married No of course I want to get married I love you Vincent You know that Its just sometimes I wonder if its ever really gonna happen HAMLIN This is Detective Hamlin Please dont touch my things That includes my gummy worms Forbes Hey uh can you talk Can you believe

sooner we can get on with our lives Any progress I ran genome sequencing on some of the outbreak victims the ones that were enhanced by the parasite Okay And I identified trace amounts of methyl aldehyde in the delivery system AKA formaldehyde Okay I dont understand How does that help Distribution is highly regulated so not many labs are gonna have it So if we can find the lab we can figure out whos behind this Yeah someones gotta be making these highly complex serums right How many labs J T Uh around Two hundred Are you kidding me man You gotta narrow it down Hey give me a break Dont you think Im trying I dont have the processing capacity to do it here and I cant very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards Okay Im sorry man Im just Im frustrated and Im hungry and Im cold Its okay I understand Wait Wait doesnt the hospital have supercomputers Yeah they do But how are you gonna get in without somebody noticing Especially the guy whos trying to kill you We gotta get

clean clothes in there Yeah scrubs Blue And hibiscus pink No wedding dress or tux by chance No sorry You know JT was right I mean there are so many labs this is gonna take days to narrow down Yeah we dont have days Neither do our friends and family Tess cant protect them forever So what are you suggesting Im suggesting that we stop running That we leave town I hate to break it to you but the assassin will keep following us Right and if we draw him out at least everyone else will be safe And give JT time to narrow down this list and figure out whos behind it all Actually Im thinking that we can figure out whos behind this ourselves By leaving town By controlling the situation yes Think about it Weve been on the defensive ever since his first attack and it isnt working We have gotta turn the tables Go on the offense Control where and when the next attack happens Surprise him for once Catherine were gonna need a pretty good reason to leave town Otherwise hes gonna think its a trap Yeah well maybe we should elope You gotta be kidding me No Not actually elope obviously just make him think that we are Were barely one step ahead of him as it is Hes gonna believe that were just taking off to elope Because he knows how desperate we are He first attacked us in a church Maybe he thinks were desperate to get married before he kills us Look I dont know Im just Im tired and Im hung ALL SCREAMING GROWLS Dont Someone might see you ALARM RINGING WOMAN All personnel we have a code silver Code silver all hospital personnel Come on we gotta stop him Thats it Were definitely eloping VINCENT Well No sign of him Yet Dont forget to bring two forms of ID For the marriage license Right Come on are you really serious about going through with this Do you have a better idea Than luring him out of town No But eloping Okay its just a ruse Vincent Its a reason for us to get out of town so he doesnt think its a trap Unless he thinks thats exactly what it is But if he does hes still gonna follow us and we can control the where and the when Okay but what if we actually have to go through with this before he attacks us Then we do Dont forget a tie We need to make it look legit Okay wait a minute Are you Are you completely okay with this Relax I already told you Yeah okay I know its a ruse but it also sounds like youre okay with it if its not Okay I dont know if youre aware of this Vincent but there is a superhuman assassin after us Can we talk about this later No No we cant okay I dont want to elope I want to get married the right way the way we deserve in front of friends and family But we cant invite our friends and family Thats the whole point of us going to Niagara Falls to protect them Im not talking about the plan I am talking about our wedding Or at least the wedding that I thought we would have Vincent it is just a ruse Okay yes but would you or wouldnt you be okay if it wasnt I dont know maybe Vincent all I know is that I love you and I want to be your wife and the sooner the better Dont you want that too Yes of course it is okay But Okay the only way to do that is for us to get our lives back first What are we gonna tell your sister Or JT or Tess for that matter We are not going to tell them anything We cant For their own safety Especially Tess Shes already risked too much trying to get everybody police protection I dont want her to get hurt helping us Okay Okay I think weve got everything Are we doing this thing or not I guess Vincent Keller I love you And I dont need a piece of paper to prove it But the bad guy might All right

tiniest detail I know Im sorry Im sorry Look Im sorry I just I dont know how to juggle it all okay I am responsible for real cases police cases and I keep getting sidetracked by Formaldehyde What I think I just narrowed down the list of labs for Vincent Were trying to backtrack who infected all those innocent victims a few days ago to try to find whos behind the experiments Not what I was talking about but okay Hold on Are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information Well yeah thats why Im here I couldnt do it from my place Certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck Thugs Those are cops JT Theyre my cops Wouldve been nice if you told me you were coming here I couldve taken them off the clock saved myself a little grief Well hopefully itll

interesting pitch the pinups idea Why didnt you tell me that in the first place Looks like hes taking the bait MAN Its me Looks like theyre going to Niagara Falls It could be a trap Should I still follow Dont worry Ill bring them back alive Wait hes not trying to kill us I know Might explain why we keep getting away from him CATHERINE Why would whoevers behind this want us back alive VINCENT I

friends Till death do us part right Yeah till death do us part CATHERINE He could be here already Watching us waiting to make his move Well hopefully he does before we elope Vincent What I dont have

this is a failed attempt Pushed the nervous system too far caused a painful overdose Please dont I am telling you the truth In a city of million people you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance I

us safe And you did You did and Im grateful I really am You did a good thing So whats the problem I dont know I dont know what the problem is okay Maybe its because youve been helping Vincent for years Maybe its guilt because hes a beast or loyalty to him I dont know But all I know is that youre not loyal to me JT at least not emotionally And maybe It is its selfish of me to want that and if
